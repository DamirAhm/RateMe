# RateMe
A web app to get other people's opinion about something (or someone, you), anonymously.

Everyone has their own opinion about you. And you have your own opinion about every people you ever met. And that opinion can be good or bad.
People mostly hide these opinions from you.  And you do that too. But when we get to know the opinions (even if it is bad), then we can grow as a person, as a human.

in an interview, Elon musk said "...Having a correct feedback loop is important...", That's what I am trying to create here.

## How to use this?

This is not usable yet. I am working as much as I can, to make it live soon. (The deadline is Jan, 27, 2021.)
